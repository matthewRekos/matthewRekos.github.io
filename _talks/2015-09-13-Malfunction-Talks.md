We gave four talks at different stages in the process for Malfunction, a function based fuzzy hashing solution for detecting code reuse in malware, as well as common static-analysis bypasses such as recompilation, or some metamorphic code solutions. All talks are available on YouTube, I recommend the DerbyCon V talk as it is the finished product when we open sourced our code. Preliminary results indicated we could detect known malware, but required unpacked code to detect more than obfuscation.

The goal of this work was to attack the developers writing the code, rather than the malware itself. Since this talk several Anti-Virus products have advertised solutions involving fuzzy hashing malware.
