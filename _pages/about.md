Welcome to my site! I'm a PhD student in Cyber Security  in his 2nd year at the University of Oxford. This site is for cataloging different talks, publications, and resources I put out on Cyber Security. My thesis on securing serial data bus networks such as CAN and 1553 from cyber attacks in ways that are system agnostic, and don't require modifications to any existing systems connected to the bus, with the hopes some of the research can be immediately useful.

My other work is mostly on malware analysis, and security education. Any talks covering that material can be seen in the [Talks section](https://matthewrekos.github.io/talks)
